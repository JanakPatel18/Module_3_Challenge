The Election Commission also wanted to the percentage of votes for each candidate.  The percentage of votes from the county with the highest amount was also requested by the commission.

## The Results of the Audit

After the audit was completed, it was concluded that Diana DeGette had won the election with receiving 73.8% of the votes in the 3 counties.  Also from the results, it showed that the votes from Denver had the highest percentage of votes from the 3 counties.  In the following set of bullets, you will see what was asked and how it was calculated.

  Total votes of the election
	Each candidateâ€™s total vote count and percentage was also reported
	for candidate_name in candidate_votes:
	.. code:: python
	        # Retrieve vote count and percentage
	        votes = candidate_votes.get(candidate_name)
	        vote_percentage = float(votes) / float(total_votes) * 100
	        candidate_results = (
	            f"{candidate_name}: {vote_percentage:.1f}% ({votes:,})\n")
	
	The winner of the election, winning vote count and winning percentage was reported
	winning_candidate_summary = (
	       f"-------------------------\n"
	        f"Winner: {winning_candidate}\n"
	        f"Winning Vote Count: {winning_count:,}\n"
	        f"Winning Percentage: {winning_percentage:.1f}%\n"
	        f"-------------------------\n")
	    print(winning_candidate_summary)
	
	Each county and its total vote count were printed to the terminal
	pct_countyvote = countyvote / total_votes * 100
	
	        county_results = (
	            f"{county}"
	            f": "
	            f"{pct_countyvote:.1f}% ("
	            f"{countyvote:,})\n")
	
	Each county and its percentage of total votes was printed to the terminal
	The county with the largest number of votes was also printed to the terminal
	 if (votes > winning_count) and (vote_percentage > winning_percentage):
	            winning_count = votes
	            winning_candidate = candidate_name
	            winning_percentage = vote_percentage


## The Summary of the Audit

	The commission can use this script for any election to get voter count and the percentage of votes per county and/or candidate.  It can also be used to get the percentage of votes for each candidate by county as well if the script is modified some.
